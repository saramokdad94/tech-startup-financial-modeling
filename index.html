    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m originally from Lebanon, with a background in engineering and a strong passion for finance. My journey into the finance world began right after college with a role in financial consulting at EY. To deepen my expertise, I pursued a master’s degree in finance at Duke University. Since then, I’ve worked at several Fortune 100 companies, gaining hands-on experience across financial services and strategy. I’m currently a Finance Manager at Oracle, where I continue to grow at the intersection of data, business insights, and financial decision-making.</p>
